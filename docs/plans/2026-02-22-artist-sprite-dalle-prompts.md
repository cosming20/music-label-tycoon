## Generation Notes

### DALL-E 3 Settings
- **Size:** 1024x1024 (will be downscaled to 64x64 in engine)
- **Style:** Natural (not vivid -- vivid overrides the pixel art aesthetic)
- **Quality:** Standard is sufficient; HD adds unnecessary detail at pixel scale

### Post-Processing Pipeline
1. Generate at 1024x1024 via DALL-E 3
2. Manual cleanup: remove any background artifacts, ensure true transparency
3. Downscale to 64x64 using nearest-neighbor interpolation (preserves pixel edges)
4. Verify black outline integrity at target resolution
5. Adjust palette to match hex values above if DALL-E drifts from specified colors
6. Export as `.png` with transparency to `assets/sprites/artists/`

### Visual Progression Summary

|------|---------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1    | Street Busker | Acoustic guitar, cap    | Sandy brown    | None             |
| 2    | Garage Band   | Electric guitar, amp    | Slate blue     | Minimal          |
| 3    | Indie Artist  | Synth, round glasses    | Medium purple  | Subtle stars     |
| 4    | Studio Pro    | Headphones, microphone  | Orange-red     | Moderate notes   |

| 7    | Legend        | Glowing guitar, aura    | Dark violet    | Aura + lightning |

Each tier intentionally escalates in three dimensions:
1. **Outfit complexity** -- from patched jeans to flowing coats
2. **Accessory count** -- from a flat cap to crowns and auras
3. **Particle/glow effects** -- from zero to full energy aura

This ensures players feel meaningful visual progression as they unlock higher-tier artists.
